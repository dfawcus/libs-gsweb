Installation
************

This file documents the installation of GNUstepWeb, `gsweb'.  Copyright
(C) 1999-2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  You may copy, distribute, and
modify it freely as long as you preserve this copyright notice and
permission notice.

   This is version 1.0.0 of GNUstepWeb.

   This package contains GNUstepWeb library. You need to install
GNUstep core and db libraries, GSWAdaptor and Apache
Please download last up to date cvs version of GNUstep (some bugs
have been corrected).

Remark: We suppose that the GNUstep folder is on /usr/GNUstep, please check all the paths below with your configuration

Installing `gsweb'
====================

 Libraries requiered :
 ---------------------

	gsantlr/	GSANTLR (Parser classes,...)
	gsgd/		Objective-C/GD Interface
	core/		GNUstep core
	db/			GNUstep database
	extensions/	Extensions
        You also need NGReflection

 The GNUStepWeb package:
 -----------------------
	* GNUstepWeb/				----->	GNUstepWeb Root
	* GNUstepWeb/GSWeb.framework		----->	GNUstepWeb Main Part
	* GNUstepWeb/GSWExtensions.framework    ----->	GNUstepWeb 'standard' Extensions
	* GNUstepWeb/GSWExtensionsGSW.framework	----->	GNUstepWeb Extensions



 Compilation Order:
 ------------------

1) core
   After the compilation ok, and the 'make install', copy core/base/Sources/md5.h on your GNUstep's Header folder: 
    /usr/GNUstep/Headers/gnustep/base/md5.h
 
2) extensions
   It adds the Header exceptions folders (both in Foundation an extensions)

3) db
4) gsantlr
5) the 'gd' libraries. You must have a /usr/include/gd.h file. If not take sources on http://www.boutell.com/gd
   Extract and compile

6) gsgd
7) NGReflection
     you can find it on ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/contrib/MOF2-fd-1999-11-03.tgz.
     Remark that this archive contains many extension. GNUstepWeb only needs the Reflections objects.
     So after the untar, go to MOF2/Foundation/NGReflection. Type make, them make install.
     You can install the others but some are not in phase with GNUstep present libraries.

8) GNUstepWeb
     Go in the GNUStepWeb folder. make and make install.

9) Apaches modules for GNUStepWeb
    Still in the GNUStepWeb folder there is a GSWAdaptors/Apache folder, go in and make. There no make install. Instead     You must copy the mod_gsweb.so module in you Apache libexec directory (something like usr/apache/libexec).

At this point everything is done, still remains the Apache configuration:

You have to export the following env var:
export GNUSTEP_STRING_ENCODING=NSISOLatin1StringEncoding

Configurating Apache:
=====================

	In Apache httpd.conf file, add thoses lines:

	LoadModule GSWeb_Module  libexec/mod_gsweb.so
	AddModule mod_gsweb.c


 If you use virtual hosts (Apache in localhost doiues not requiered them), add the following lines:

	<Location /GSWeb*>
		SetHandler GSWeb
	</Location>

 Next if /etc/httpd/conf folders does not exist, you have to create them.
 In this folder create an file file named gsweb-log (that will be GNUStepWeb reports file)
 Then, create the file /etc/httpd/conf/gsweb.conf which contains parameters for GNUstepWeb Applications: 

 The format is(there is an example for values below):

The format is (there is an example for values below):
{
	applications=    {
				ApplicationName =  {
							instances =      (
 												{
													instanceNum= InstanceNumber;
													host= IPAdressOfTheComputerOnWhichRunTheApplication;
													port= ThePortListenByTheApplication;
													parameters=      {
																		transport= socket;
																		};
												 }
								       		);
									};
						};
}


exemple values for a localhost use: 
{
	applications=    {
				MyApp =  {
						instances =      (
				{
					instanceNum= 1;
					host= 127.0.0.1;
					port= 9001;
					parameters=      {
										transport= socket;
									};
				}
								      );
						};
					};
}


Now, develop an application and runnit !

We'll try to put a sample application soon.
