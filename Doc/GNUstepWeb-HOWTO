Introduction
============

   This document explains how to build GNUstepWeb applications, explain
differences from Apple WebObjects and known bug of these libraries.


Project wrapper
===============

   Follow these guidelines to maintain your GSWeb application wrapper.

   MyApp/                     Application wrapper
     Main.gswc/               First page requested by GSWeb
       Main.html
       Main.gswd

     MyApp_main.m             main() function
     Main.m                   Your Main class code
     Main.h                   Your Main class interface
     
     GNUmakefile
     Makefile.preamble
     Makefile.postamble

     Main.gswa/               Compiled application
     Main.debug/              Compiled application with debug support


Makefiles
=========


Debug
=====

   In order to debug your application compile it with "gmake debug=yes" and
install with "gmake install debug=yes". You'll find your application in
GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/GSWApps/MyApp.debug

   Now you can enable debug starting your app with -GSWebDebug=<option>
   
   Options
   -------------
   dflt
   GSWebFn
   seriousError
   exception
   error
   gswdync
   low
   gswcomponents
   associations
   sessions
   bundles
   requests
   resmanager
   options
   info
   

   There are two special options: all and most. The following table explain
which options enable.

   Options          all    most
   -------------    ---    ----
   dflt              x      x
   GSWebFn           x
   seriousError      x      x
   exception         x      x
   error             x      x
   gswdync           x      x
   low               x
   gswcomponents     x      x
   associations      x      x
   sessions          x
   bundles           x
   requests          x      x
   resmanager        x
   options           x
   info              x      x


NOTE: GSWeb will search componentes first in GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/GSWApps/Myapp.gswa
      so before start your debug app remove or update MyApp.gswa wrapper
      with "gmake install".


Threaded applications
=====================

   By default GSWeb will start your application in Multi Thread mode.
In order to use this facility your libobjc.a must be compiled with thread
support, else you app won't work.

   If you don't have ObjC thread support start your app with -GSWMTEnabled NO


WebObjects compatibility
========================

   WebScript is not implemented yet, you can only use compiled components.
You must use Objective-C code, at the moment there aren't equivalent
Java classes.

   The following table explain suffix differences:

   Name                        WebObjects    GSWeb
   ----                        ----------    -----
   Application                 woa           gswa
   Component                   wo            gswc
   Component definition        wod           gswd
   Script                      wos           gsws
   Archive                     woo           gswi
   Library                     woso          gswso
   URL Prefix                  /WebObjects   /GSWeb
   Resource request handler    wr            rr
   Component request handler   wo            cr
   Direct request handler      wa            dr
   ObjC classes prefix         WO            GSW

   If you need WO name space compatibility set to 1 GSWEB_NAMES in
GSWeb.framework/GSWConfig.h and recompile all the libraries.


Known bugs
==========

   In order to make your application working you can follow these guidelines:
   
1. In main() always create an autorelease pool before invoking
   GSWApplicationMain(), eg:

   int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
   {
     int ret = 0;
     NSAutoreleasePool *arp = [NSAutoreleasePool new];

     ret = GSWApplicationMain(@"Application", argc, argv);
     [arp release];
     return ret;
   }

2. Always create an Application and Session class also if you don't use them.

   @interface Session:GSWSession
   {
   }

   @end

   @interface Application:GSWApplication
   {
   }

   @end

   @implementation Session
   @end

   @implementation Application
   @end

3. Start your application with -GSWHost hostname else it will crash.

4. In your component definition file (gswd or wod) don't use spaces between
   GSWeb NAME and component name, eg:
   
   <GSWEB NAME = "NAME_FIELD"></GSWEB>   This does NOT work
   <GSWEB NAME="NAME_FIELD"></GSWEB>     This work
